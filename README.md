## What is Morpheus?

Morpheus is a visual interface that lets you compose multi-step DeFi strategies on top of Morpho Blue. Instead of executing transactions one by one, you design your strategy as a flow of connected nodes on an interactive canvas, then execute everything in a single bundled transaction.

**Example**: Supply wstETH as collateral → Borrow USDC → Swap to WETH via CoW Swap → Deposit into a vault — all in one click.

## Features

### Canvas — Visual Strategy Builder

The core of Morpheus. Drag-and-drop nodes onto a canvas to build strategies visually.

**Node types:**
| Node | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Wallet** | Starting point — shows your token balances |
| **Supply Collateral** | Supply assets as collateral to a Morpho market |
| **Borrow** | Borrow against supplied collateral with custom LTV |
| **Swap** | Execute token swaps via CoW Swap |
| **Vault Deposit** | Deploy assets into ERC-4626 vaults |
| **Vault Withdraw** | Withdraw from existing vault positions |
| **Repay** | Repay borrowed positions |

**Canvas features:**
- Drag & drop nodes from sidebar or use keyboard shortcuts (`S`, `B`, `X`, `D`, `W`, `R`)
- Smart connection validation — only valid flows are allowed
- Auto-layout to organize nodes
- Save/load strategies to browser storage
- Export strategy as PNG screenshot
- Undo/redo (`Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Shift+Z`)
- Import existing on-chain positions directly onto the canvas

### Strategy — Guided Form Builder

A step-by-step interface for users who prefer a linear workflow over freeform canvas:

1. View your active positions
2. Pick collateral assets
3. Choose a loan asset
4. Configure borrow amounts across markets
5. Simulate health factor and liquidation prices
6. Select vaults and allocate funds
7. Review and execute the full transaction bundle

### Address Explorer

Inspect any address's Morpho activity:
- Supply, collateral, borrow, and vault positions with USD values
- Full transaction history (deposits, borrows, repays, liquidations)
- Net worth dashboard
- One-click import of positions into the canvas

## Supported Chains

- **Ethereum** (Mainnet)
- **Base**
